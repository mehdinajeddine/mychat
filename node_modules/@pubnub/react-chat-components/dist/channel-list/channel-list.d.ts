 * passed into it. A common pattern in chat applications is to render two instances of the
 * component - one visible all the time to show joined channels, and another one hidden inside a
 * modal with channels available to join. Make sure to handle the onChannelSwitched event to switch
 * the current channel passed to the Chat provider.
